            In recent years, COVID-19 policy measures massively affected university teaching. Seeking an effective and viable way to 
            transform their lecture material into asynchronous online settings, many lecturers relied on prerecorded video lectures.

                <h2 class="color_letra fuente1">The risks of asynchronous video lectures: interruptions and lack of engagement</h2>
                <p>Asynchronous video lectures enable learners to choose their time and location of learning, but also carry some risks,
                    such as interruptions and lack of students’ engagement. First, the risks of getting interrupted by other people, 
                    devices, or noises may be bigger in an unsupervised place of one’s own choice than in the university hall or 
                    classroom (<span class="negrita">Benson, Blasiman</span> <abbr title="et alia"> et al</abbr>). After all, the lecturer’s presence might have at least some corrective influence 
                    to assure a quiet learning environment.</p>
                <p>However, interruptions by digital devices are a ubiquitous phenomenon that afflicts many learners, gaining notoriety 
                    under the phrase <span class="cursiva">digital distraction</span> (<span class="negrita">Flanigan</span> & <span class="negrita">Titsworth</span>) and the euphemism <span class="cursiva">media multitasking</span>. <span class="negrita verde_oscuro">Students simply cannot withstand succumbing to use their mobile devices</span> (such as smart phones, tablets, and laptops) for off-task purposes, which they do to an excessive extent.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="color_letra fuente1">Prompts for self-explanations</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, we are focusing on self-explaining as the key learning activity to encourage students to benefit from a given video lecture. Note that <span class="cursiva">self-explaining</span> is not the present participle that describes self-explanatory learning material. Self-explaining is the gerund; it is an ongoing activity that simply means generating an explanation to oneself. Decades of research revealed that the endeavor of self-explaining is a powerful learning strategy, a constructive cognitive endeavor (<abbr title="exempli gratia"> e.g.</abbr>, <span class="negrita">Bichler</span><abbr title="et alia"> et al</abbr>).</p>

                <p>In the context of learning from explanations, active and constructive prompts can be distinguished. This differentiation is based on the active–constructive–interactive framework by <span class="negrita">Chi</span> —a predecessor of the aforementioned <abbr title="Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive."> ICAP</abbr> framework.</p>
                <blockquote class="cursiva">
                    <p>Active prompts, called engaging prompts, should encourage learners to actively think about the content of instructional explanations</p>

                <h2 class="color_letra fuente1">Hypotheses</h2>
                <p>In the present study, we supplemented a prerecorded video lecture on the topic <span class="cursiva">Cognitive Apprenticeship</span> with different kinds of prompts and compared those types in an online field experiment. Against the previously discussed background, we aimed to investigate the instructional efficacy of different types of prompts (<abbr title="exempli gratia">e.g.</abbr>, note prompts, principle-based self-explanation prompts, elaboration-based self-explanation prompts, and both) on students’ learning processes and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we examined the roles of learners’ engagement in the form of interruptions (<abbr title="exempli gratia">e.g.</abbr>, self-reports on how often they were interrupted by other people or events/incidents) and persistence (<abbr title="exempli gratia">e.g.</abbr>, actual participation in a delayed posttest).</p>
                <p>Referring to learning processes and as a manipulation check, we predicted that…</p>
